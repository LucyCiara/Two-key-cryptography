# Two-key-cryptography
A barebones program (as in it can't edit (for example) a file without minor adjustments) for RSA two-key encryption, decryption and key generation. The RSA keys are meant to encrypt a symmetrical key in (for example) an AES system. To encrypt (for example) a whole file would take too long with RSA, so the method of encrypting a symmetrical key as a means of safely sharing that key would be a more correct and efficient way to use the RSA keys. The public key is meant to be shared, such that someone could encrypt a message (symmetrical key) with it which only you could decrypt. You can also encrypt with your private key to validate your identity.
